		<p style="color:white;">Unethical hacking refers to illegal or unauthorized access to computer systems with malicious intent, also known as black hat hacking. This involves actions like distributing malware to steal data, holding systems for ransom, or destroying information for personal gain, financial profit, or other illicit motives. This is distinct from ethical hacking, where hackers are hired by an organization to find vulnerabilities with permission to improve security. </p>
