		<p>Ethical hacking is the authorized practice of using hacking techniques to find and fix security vulnerabilities in a computer system, network, or application before malicious actors can exploit them. Unlike malicious hackers, ethical hackers operate with the explicit permission of the owner, with the goal of improving an organization's security posture and protecting data from breaches.<p>
